## Linear Modelling Exercises

1. Import the data found in bird1.csv
2. Fit a linear model, and interpret the coefficients.
3. Examine the diagnostics plot. Is everything OK?
3. Calculate the residual sum of squares (find sum the squared difference between the estimates calculated from the coefficients and the observed values).
4. Recalculate the Residual sum of squares using different values for the coefficients (in the formula yi = Beta + Beta xi + Îµi).
5. Is the new RSS larger or smaller?
6. Estimate the slope using covariance and variance.
7. Do you get the same result?
8. Create a linear model (one-way anova) with the factor of C & T as the predictor
9. Compare the SST with the regression model.
10. Are there any difference.
12. How should the coefficients be interpreted?

13. Import the data found in bird2.csv
14. Fit a linear model with both temperature and gender as predictors.
15. How should we interpret the results?
16. What is the difference in intercept between male and female birds?
17. How much does the slope differ between male and female?
18. Is this significant?
